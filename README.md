# ZNC-Signal

An experimental highlight/search
forwarder<sup>[1](NOTES.md#user-content-forwarder)</sup>
inspired by [ZNC Push][] but exclusive to a [single service][]â€”with limited
support for remote interactions (chat from your phone)

### Requirements and dependencies
- A [dedicated Signal number](NOTES.md#getting-a-number) for this account alone
- [ZNC][] 1.8
- [signal-cli][] 0.10.0
- [jeepney][] 0.7.1 (submodule included)

### Notice
This project has been **retired** except for a very narrow use
case<sup>[1](#user-content-use_case)</sup>. Sorry! See old [notes](Notes.md)
for installation, etc. (mostly stale/obsolete).
